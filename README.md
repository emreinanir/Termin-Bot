# Mainz Appointment Notification Bot  

This bot script serves as the foundation for more advanced automation projects I plan to develop in the future. It is a simple but functional project designed to help users automatically get notified when earlier appointment slots become available on the **Mainz B√ºrgeramt** website.  

---

##  Purpose  

The bot monitors the following section of the Mainz B√ºrgeramt appointment system:  

**Abteilung Ausl√§nderangelegenheiten ‚Üí √úbertr√§ge von Aufenthaltstiteln (neuer Pass)**  
üëâ [Mainz B√ºrgeramt Appointment Page](https://termine-reservieren.de/termine/buergeramt.mainz/?rs)  

Whenever an earlier appointment is released (for example, due to cancellation), the bot automatically sends an **email notification** to the user.

---

##  How It Works  

1. The bot scans all available appointment dates within the next **12 days**.  
2. When it finds an earlier date, it automatically **sends an email** to the configured user address.  
3. Every **12 minutes**, it logs into the website through the user‚Äôs Chrome browser and checks for new openings.  
4. Users can adjust both the check interval and search window duration directly in the source code.

## üß© Configuration  

The default configuration can be modified in the script:  

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| `CHECK_INTERVAL` | Time between automatic checks | `12 minutes` |
| `SEARCH_RANGE` | Appointment search window | `12 days` |
| `EMAIL_RECEIVER` | Recipient address for notifications | *(user-defined)* |
| `EMAIL_SENDER` | Sender email address (SMTP account) | *(user-defined)* |

## üß† Example Workflow  

1. The bot starts and launches a headless Chrome instance.  
2. It opens the Mainz B√ºrgeramt appointment page and navigates to the ‚Äú√úbertr√§ge von Aufenthaltstiteln (neuer Pass)‚Äù section.  
3. It checks for available appointments within the next 12 days.  
4. If an earlier appointment is found, it sends an automatic email to the configured recipient.  
5. It waits 12 minutes and repeats the process.  

---

## üõ† Customization  

To change the default values, modify the variables near the top of the script:  

```python
CHECK_INTERVAL = 12 * 60  # 12 minutes in seconds
SEARCH_RANGE = 12         # in days
```

You can also customize:
- Email templates
